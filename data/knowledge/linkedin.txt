Summary
I’m currently on an exciting journey pursuing my Master’s in
Computer Science at NJIT, where I’m diving deep into the world of
data and cloud technologies. My passion lies in using these tools to
tackle complex challenges head-on. With over two years of hands-
on experience as a Data Engineer and Associate Data Scientist,
I’ve had the chance to work on some pretty cool projects that have
shaped my skills in Python, SQL, and ETL processes.
One of my proudest moments was at Sail Analytics, where I led end-
to-end data engineering projects that not only supported our analysts
but also boosted team productivity by 25%. It was rewarding to see
how optimizing our BigQuery pipeline management made a tangible
difference. Similarly, during my time at VeeyoTech, I developed
LLM-powered chatbots that enhanced customer support while fine-
tuning BERT models—an experience that truly ignited my interest in
machine learning.
I believe in the power of collaboration and continuous learning.
That’s why I love working with diverse teams to create innovative
solutions. For instance, while automating Excel report generation
through data pipelines at Sail Analytics, we managed to reduce
processing times by 40%, which felt like a huge win for everyone
involved! 
Outside of work and studies, I enjoy exploring new technologies
and contributing to open-source projects whenever I can. Whether
it’s integrating NodeJS with Google Cloud for scalable systems or
experimenting with IoT integrations during my internship at tronX-
things, I’m always eager to learn something new.
