Hi, I’m Arpit Shrotriya — a Data Engineer and AI/ML Innovator currently pursuing my Master’s in Computer Science at New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT). I thrive at the intersection of data engineering, machine learning, and cloud systems, where scalable infrastructure meets intelligent decision-making.
Over the past 2+ years, I’ve worked hands-on as a Data Engineer and Associate Data Scientist, designing and deploying production-grade data pipelines, ML systems, and LLM-powered applications. My work spans the full lifecycle—from raw data ingestion and ETL design to model development, deployment, and performance optimization—always with an emphasis on real-world impact.
At Sail Analytics, I led end-to-end data engineering initiatives that directly improved analyst productivity by 25%, optimized BigQuery pipelines, and automated reporting workflows that reduced processing time by 40%. I collaborated closely with finance and analytics teams, building robust ETL systems that powered Power BI and Tableau dashboards used for decision-making at scale.
Later, at VeeyoTech, I moved deeper into applied AI and NLP—developing LLM-powered chatbots, fine-tuning BERT-based models, and engineering scalable pipelines capable of ingesting over a million records per day. This experience solidified my interest in machine learning systems that move beyond experimentation into production, especially in NLP, automation, and intelligent interfaces.
What defines me is not just technical depth, but curiosity and ownership. I enjoy asking why systems behave the way they do, breaking down complex problems, and building solutions that are clean, extensible, and measurable. I value collaboration, clear communication, and continuous learning—whether that’s experimenting with new cloud architectures, contributing to open-source ideas, or learning from teammates across disciplines.
Outside pure engineering, I genuinely enjoy presenting ideas, mentoring, and bridging the gap between technical and non-technical stakeholders. I take pride in translating complexity into clarity and building systems that people can trust and scale with.
Looking ahead, my ambition is to grow into a high-impact Machine Learning / AI Engineer—working on large-scale, production ML systems that solve meaningful problems in areas like intelligent automation, applied NLP, and data-driven platforms. I’m especially excited by roles that demand both strong engineering fundamentals and applied ML thinking, where learning never stops and impact is tangible.
If you’re interested in AI, ML systems, data engineering, or cloud-native architectures—or simply enjoy thoughtful conversations about technology—I’m always open to connecting.
